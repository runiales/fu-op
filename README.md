# README

This is a basic machine learning project written in Python 3.7 for a data analysis course taught by Prof. Kiril Ralinivski at the Freie Universit√§t of Berlin on the 2019 summer semester. 
The goal was to write a MNIST or MNIST-like program with some added interaction/explanations.

I have used guides from Tensorflow's homepage, Kaggle and pythonprograming.net in order to lear how to create this basic model.

This project can be extended to a score analysis project using Bach's chorales found in the library music21.
